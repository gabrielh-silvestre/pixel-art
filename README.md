## My process

### Built with

- React
- React contexts
- Tailwind
- Styled-Components

### What I Learned

In this project I understood the power and simplicity of the contexts in compare of Redux, I also learned the basics of Styled-Components and Tailwind Styled-Components.

### Continued development

The biggest problem in this project is the performance when the canvas exced a size of 40x40, I plan to solve this problem untill february of 2022.

### Useful resources
